- 👋 Hi, I’m @benvizy
- 👀 I’m interested in using code to visualize our journey through life. The union of the digital and physical world gives us more control over this incarnation than ever before in what we know of our species' linear history. As I improve my coding skills, I seek to empower indivduals through code, finding ways for us to accumulate, organize and visualize our data in personal ways. I currently have intermediate skills in Swift Development for iOS, python, and Web Development using the MERN stack.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Soidity and Web3 Frameworks
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything!
- 📫 How to reach me: send me an email at forprosperllc@gmail.com. Let me know if you have an exciting project you would like my help on--I'm currently accepting Dogecoin for tips 🐈‍⬛
