- 👋 Hi, I’m @benvizy
- 👀 I’m interested in using code to visualize our journey through life. The union of the digital and physical world gives us incredible control over this incarnation. As I improve my coding skills, I seek to empower indivduals through code, finding ways for us to accumulate, organize and visualize our data in personal ways. I currently have intermediate skills in Swift Development for iOS, python, and Web Development using the MERN stack.
- 🌱 I’m currently in the middle of the Moralis hackathon with @magnusquest! Using Astro framework, Moralis API and Stable Diffusion
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything! Let's set the people free together 🙌🏽 
- 📫 How to reach me: send me an email at forprosperllc@gmail.com. Let me know if you have an exciting project you would like my help on--accepting Dogecoin for tips 🐈‍⬛
